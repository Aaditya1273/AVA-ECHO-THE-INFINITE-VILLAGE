# 🎬 Sphira - 1 Minute Demo Script (Stellar Hackathon)

## 🎯 The Script (60 seconds)

**[0:00-0:10] The Hook**
> "What if I told you we've built something that doesn't just USE Stellar... but PROVES why it's the future of DeFi? Watch this."

**[0:10-0:25] The Demo**
**[Connect wallet, show real balance]**
> "I connect my Stellar wallet - REAL balance from Futurenet. Now I create a Systematic Investment Plan: 500 XLM, daily, 4 months. I sign the transaction..."

**[Sign in Freighter]**
> "And in 3 seconds... DONE. Transaction confirmed on Stellar blockchain."

**[0:25-0:40] The Proof**
**[Show transaction hash, navigate to verify page]**
> "Here's the proof. I paste the transaction hash, query Stellar's Horizon API directly, and boom - verified on blockchain. Ledger 1654089. Immutable. Permanent. REAL."

**[Show SIP live on dashboard]**
> "My SIP is now LIVE. Automated. On-chain. Unstoppable."

**[0:40-0:55] The Power**
> "This isn't a demo. This is production-ready code. Three Soroban smart contracts. Real transactions. Sub-cent costs. 3-second finality. We didn't just build ON Stellar - we built something that proves WHY Stellar wins."

**[0:55-1:00] The Close**
**[Show Sphira + Stellar logos]**
